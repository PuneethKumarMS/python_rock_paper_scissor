# ✊🖐️✌️ Rock–Paper–Scissors Game

A simple command-line **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game built in Python.  
The player chooses between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects one. The winner is decided based on the classic game rules.

This project is part of my **Python learning journey**, where I practiced working with loops, conditionals, user input, and the `random` module.
